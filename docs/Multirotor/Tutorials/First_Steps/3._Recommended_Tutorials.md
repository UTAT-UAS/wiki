## ROS2

> The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.

For our team ROS2 acts as the middleware the binds all of our systems together, it enables communication with the drone and is a key interface we develop against.

Main documentation: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)

To get started go through the beginner tutorials: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)

You can skip the `Configuring environment` section if you are using the development container, but I would read it anyways.

I recommend using using the `uas_ws` directory for your workspace as the container's `.bashrc` comes preconfigured to use this workspace.

The basic concepts page is also a good place to learn more about ROS: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts.html)

## PX4

> PX4 is the Professional Autopilot. Developed by world-class developers from industry and academia, and supported by an active world wide community, it powers all kinds of vehicles from racing and cargo drones through to ground vehicles and submersibles.

PX4 is our chosen autopilot and contains the fundamental routines that allow the drone to fly.

The drones currently use PX4 v1.16 so select that version of the docs to get the most relevant information.

Main documentation: [https://docs.px4.io/main/en/](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/)

Read the basic concepts page to get familiar with basic drone concepts: [https://docs.px4.io/main/en/getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.html](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.html)

We make heavy use of offboard control for our autonomy, specially we use ROS2 and the uXRCE-DDS interface, there are quite a few pages, but skim a few to get a feel for what we are working with: [https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/offboard_control.html](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/offboard_control.html)

We are specifically using the uXRCE-DDS bridge to communicate with the drone, see here to learn more about its implementation: [https://docs.px4.io/main/en/middleware/uxrce_dds.html](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/middleware/uxrce_dds.html)

## Gazebo

> Gazebo brings a fresh approach to simulation with a complete toolbox of development libraries and cloud services to make simulation easy. Iterate fast on your new physical designs in realistic environments with high fidelity sensors streams. Test control strategies in safety, and take advantage of simulation in continuous integration tests.

PX4 has already done most of the setup for us, but if you are interested in modifying the simulation or just want to learn more, feel free to read a few pages.

## Onboarding Project

The best way to get familiar with the basics is by doing as such I have scoped a smallish scale learning project that you can undertake (not for marks).

To get started create a ROS package in `uas_ws/src`, use the PX4 offboard docs as reference.

Requirements (purposefully open ended):

- Software system that enables autonomous control of a drone in simulation
- The system should:
  - Allow the drone to take off
  - Allow the drone to go to a location via local coordinates
  - Allow the drone to go to a location via global coordinates
  - Allow the drone to land
- Can be done either in Python or C++ or both or anything you want.

Demonstrate:

- Take off
- The drone creates a square pattern in the sky (manual coordinates)
- The drone creates a square pattern in the sky (generated at runtime coordinates)
- The drone creates a shape of your choosing in the sky
- Landing

These are all concepts that are used in our actual systems, by learning them on your own you will have easier time understanding them and you will develop a unique perspective for the team.

Consult this wiki and the `dev_env` README for additional reference.
