## ROS2

Main documentation: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)

To get started go through the beginner tutorials: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)

You can skip the `Configuring environment` section if you are using the development container, but I would read it anyways.

I recommend using using the `uas_ws` directory for your workspace as the container's `.bashrc` comes preconfigured to use this workspace.

The basic concepts page is also a good place to learn more about ROS: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts.html)

## PX4

Main documentation: [https://docs.px4.io/main/en/](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/)

Read the basic concepts page to get familiar with basic drone concepts: [https://docs.px4.io/main/en/getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.html](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.html)

We make heavy use of offboard control for our autonomy, specially we use ROS2 and the uXRCE-DDS interface, there are quite a few pages, but skim a few to get a feel for what we are working with: [https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/offboard_control.html](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/offboard_control.html)

## Onboarding Project

The best way to get familiar with the basics is by doing as such I have scoped a smallish scale learning project that you can undertake (not for marks).

To get started create a ROS package in `uas_ws/src`, use the PX4 offboard docs as reference.

Requirements (purposefully open ended):

- Software system that enables autonomous control of a drone in simulation
- The system should:
  - Allow the drone to take off
  - Allow the drone to go to a location via local coordinates
  - Allow the drone to go to a location via global coordinates
  - Allow the drone to land
- Can be done either in Python or C++ or both or anything you want.

Demonstrate:

- Take off
- The drone creates a square pattern in the sky (manual coordinates)
- The drone creates a square pattern in the sky (generated at runtime coordinates)
- Landing

These are all concepts that are used in our actual systems, by learning them on your own you will have easier time understanding them and you will develop a unique perspective for the team.

Consult this wiki and the `dev_env` README for additional reference.
