This is one of the many reasons that makes Linux favoured in robotics applications. Specific to us is the distribution of Linux known as <code>Ubuntu 22.04</code>, which is the only version of Linux that <code>ROS2 Humble</code> officially supports. It is also the only distribution that <code>Gazebo</code> officially supports, and the PX4 development toolchain does not support native Windows.</p> <p>A <code>distribution</code> of Linux is an operating system that uses the Linux kernel, different distribution will package software differently, release updates differently, use different init systems, come with different default software, and much more.</p> <p>This guide recommends the native installation of <code>Ubuntu 22.04</code> for development as this is a relatively user friendly distribution and will help you get familiar with the developer environment in which we work.</p> <p>These tutorials will assume you are using Linux, WSL and macOS notes will be provided when applicable. (PRs welcome)</p> <p>Note that once you get the container setup, your host OS will be largely irrelevant.</p> WSL2 <p>Docker on Windows via WSL2 can be used, however Gazebo (the simulator) seems to have problems with using the GPU.

Documentation contributions are welcome.</p> macOS <p>Running the container with x86 emulation should theoretically work, but we have never gotten this working.  You will need an Xserver for Mac.  You may find it easiest to create a VM, an x86 VM is recommended, but you are welcome to try on ARM.  Intel Macs should theoretically work with minimal issues.  Documentation contributions are welcome.</p> ARM <p>Some newer Windows 11 computers (and Apple and Linux) use the ARM instruction set. Unfortunately ARM is not officially supported by PX4 so you will either have to attempt to build the container yourself with some patches (see #Environment), run Docker with some sort of x86 emulation tool, or run Linux in an x86 VM.</p> Other Linux Distros <p>Thanks to containerized development any distro should be compatible with no issues. If you using a different distro please follow your distributions instructions for installing Docker, git, etc.</p> Do I actually need to use this? <p>If you are so inclined it is very much possible to get the required software running without the container.

It provides a concurrency and parallelism framework for our applications and brings a standardized pub/sub, service, and action based IPC mechanism.</p> <p>Main documentation: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html</p> <p>Recommend Tutorials to complete: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html</p> <ul> <li>All of <code>Beginner: CLI tools</code><ul> <li>Most of <code>Configuring environment</code> has been done for you if you are using the development container, but you should read it anyways to get familiar with the CLI.<ul> <li>We do not set <code>ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1</code> because the container is not setup for <code>network_mode: host</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Most of <code>Beginner: Client libraries</code><ul> <li>Using colcon to build packages</li> <li>Creating a workspace</li> <li>Creating a package</li> <li>Writing a simple publisher and subscriber (C++)</li> <li>Writing a simple publisher and subscriber (Python)</li> <li>Writing a simple service and client (C++)</li> <li>Writing a simple service and client (Python)</li> <li>Creating custom msg and srv files</li> <li>Implementing custom interfaces</li> <li>Using parameters in a class (C++)</li> <li>Using parameters in a class (Python)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I recommend using using the <code>uas_ws</code> directory for your workspace as the container's <code>.bashrc</code> comes preconfigured to use this workspace.</p> <p>The concepts page is good place to learn more about the inner workings of ROS: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts.html</p>"},{"location":"Multirotor/Tutorials/First_Steps/3._Recommended_Tutorials/#px4","title":"PX4","text":"<p>PX4 is the Professional Autopilot.
